To run the program:
1. clone/download github repo
2. go to Cognalisys-programming-exercise/cognalysis_exercise directory in terminal
3. "java PolicyRunner" in the terminal to run policy calculation for all policies in input.txt

Change input.txt to test different policies (given the policies input follow the format), change dateString variable in PolicyRunner to change valuation date (given the string date follows format in input file i.e. MM/DD/YYYY)
